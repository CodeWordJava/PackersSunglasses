## Day 1
After pulling together the designs in figma for the UX challenege I wanted to see if I could underpin my react learning further so I started to build out the app.
Today i made the plan for the first page and then set up each component and its folder.

### Challeneges
I had never used a local image in React so this took some working through and some advice from a fellow bootcamper to get it to work.
importing the MUI library was also difficult at first because the documentation wasn't clear on the import statments required.
CSS is also being pesky in that it will not pick up some elements and custom fonts are loaded but not displaying

### Wins
Working out how to use themes with the MUI componenets to style them. This felt like a huge win after my friend mentioned they were really testing to try to do.
remembering to plan and break down each step
